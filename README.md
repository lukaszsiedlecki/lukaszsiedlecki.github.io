# Hi, I'm Łukasz. 👋

### *Software Engineer | Cloud Architect | Engineering Enthusiast*

I am a Software Engineer with **over a decade of experience** specializing in the Java and Spring ecosystem. Throughout my career, I've focused heavily on delivering complex business value. Now, I am shifting my focus closer to the metal.

**I believe that to be a complete engineer, you must understand the platform, not just the code.**

### 🚀 The Mission: From Code to Kernel

I created this blog to bridge the gap between **Application Development** and **Infrastructure Operations**. I am combining my software engineering background with my passion for DevOps to build a holistic view of modern systems.

As a **Certified Google Professional Cloud Architect**, I work with cloud-native technologies daily. However, I am a firm believer in hands-on experimentation. That's why I run a local **Proxmox homelab** hosting a **Talos Linux** Kubernetes cluster - my personal playground for breaking and fixing things.

### 🎯 Engineering Roadmap

In an era of AI and rapid abstraction, I believe **deep specialization** is the key to relevance. My goal is to demystify what happens "under the hood."

Here, I document my deep dives into:

- 🐧 **Linux Internals:** Going beyond administration into system architecture.
- ☸️ **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Building and breaking clusters from scratch.
- ☕ **JVM Deep Dives:** Memory models, GC tuning, and bytecode analysis.
- 📡 **Observability & SRE:** Moving beyond simple logging to Distributed Tracing, OpenTelemetry, and eBPF.
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code:** Managing reality with Terraform and embracing GitOps principles.
- 🌐 **Modern Networking:** Dissecting protocols like HTTP/3 (QUIC), gRPC, and CNI plugins.
- 📐 **Algorithmic Mastery:** Refining the core logic that powers efficient software.
